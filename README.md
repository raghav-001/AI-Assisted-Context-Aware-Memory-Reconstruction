# AI-Driven Conversational Support for Mental Health Assistance
This project is an AI-driven mental health support system using the MentalChat16K dataset, which includes transcripts of mental health conversations for conditions like depression and anxiety. The system integrates a fine-
tuned Large Language Model(LLM) with a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, enabling personalized, context-aware conversations by maintaining interaction history.
